# Regression-methods-using-ATM-dataset
 The purpose of this exercise is to chose the best regression model for predicting total amount of cash withdrawal. In this project I will focus on Linear Regression models and compare it to Lasso, SVR, Kneighbors, Decision Tree Models. Explatory data analysis of this data was done in separate project.
 Data comes from Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saadfareed/data-set-of-atm-transaction-of-xyz-bank It has 10 columns and 11589 rows. It contains ATMs transactions of XYZ cards and no XYZ cards from 2011 till 2016, value of this trancations and information which day of the week the withdrawal has been done. Transactions cames from five ATMs.The location was not changed from 2011 till 2016. I will pre-process data for models I will build.
